TASK 1: 


COPY BY VALUE:
       1. In Copy by value the data which variable holds is passed to another variable. 
       2. Both the variables refer to two different memory locations.
       3.Primitive data types are performed. i.e.,Numbers,boolean,string,float...
       3. Even if contents of Copied variable are changed, the original variable value from which it is copied remains the same .
   Example: 
         var a=10;
         var b=a;
         console.log(a,b);
          > 10 10
         b=20;
         console.log(a,b)
          > 10 20
                   
COPY BY REFERENCE:
       1.For composite data types objects are copied by reference. i.e.,arrays and objects,functions.
       2. Actual variable and copied variable both refer to the same memory location.
       3. SO change in data of copied variable will lead to change in data of original variable too. 
    Example:
          var a={name:"bts",age:7};
          var b=a;
          console.log(a,b);
          > {name: "bts", age: 7} {name: "bts", age: 7}
          b.name="bangtan";
          console.log(a,b);
          > {name: "bangtan", age: 7} {name: "bangtan", age: 7}
